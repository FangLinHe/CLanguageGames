## My first C games in command line window
- Bingo game:
  You can execute [bingo.exe](bingo.exe).  Enter 0 to fill the cells randomly.  I just found some bugs to manually fill the cells, so don't try it.

- Minesweeper game:
  You can execute [minesweeper.exe](minesweeper.exe).  Enter the row number and column number to sweep the mine.  For example, row 1 and column 9: enter _1 9_.

They are all in Chinese language.

## Little story about this minesweeper game:

After learning C language for one semester when I was a freshman (or should I say freshwoman?), it was the time close to final exams...
"Hmm!  I want to write a minesweeper game!" Suddenly I had this idea, and that's how this game had been produced. It was not that easy to me, since at that time I had not learned data structure and algorithms. However, it was so interesting to design and implement this game totally by myself (of course with the assistance of Google).  I also shared it on my blog and got downloaded by so many people: [http://blog.udn.com/gn01897234/2562496](http://blog.udn.com/gn01897234/2562496).  The user interface is not that friendly, but at least I have tried my best to align the words.

## Little story about this bingo game:

After finishing the minesweeper game, it was the winter vacation.  And one day, again, I strongly wanted to write the bingo game, and that's why it's here again.  This time it was more challenged.  I remember I didn't know how to produce numbers 1 to 25 in a random order.  By googling, I found an easy way called "shuffling" and implemented.  Also, I even tried to install gcc on my little precious EEEPC, which was equipped with only 4 GB disk, just because I wanted to code this game when I was in my hometown without my desktop computer.  Another challenge was, how should I play with computer?  At that time, I had not learned data structure and algorithms, of coursed I did not know artificial intelligence.  I came up with the idea to count the score for each row, column and diagonal by adding one if a number on the line was selected, so I simply choose the number with highest score, or randomly choose one if all numbers have the same score.  I also shared my code on my blog again, and also got at least dozens of downloading: [http://blog.udn.com/gn01897234/2807044](http://blog.udn.com/gn01897234/2807044).

I also found that I implemented and shared another two computer vision algorithms (not very "correct" methods, since I was just an immature freshman.): [changing the brightness of the image](http://blog.udn.com/gn01897234/2722185) and [edge detection](http://blog.udn.com/gn01897234/2740769).  They were also written in Chinese.  Unfortunately I have not updated the blog for a long time and hided most of the articles.
